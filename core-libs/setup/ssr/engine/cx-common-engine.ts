   * If an error is populated from the rendered applications
   * (via `PROPAGATE_ERROR_TO_SERVER` callback), then such an error
   * will be thrown and the result promise rejected - but only AFTER the rendering is complete.
   * In other words, at first an error occurs and it's captured, then we wait until the rendering completes
   * and ONLY then we reject the promise with the payload being the encountered error.
   *
   * Note: if more errors are captured during the rendering, only the first one will be used
   *       as the payload of the rejected promise, others won't.
   *
   * @param {CommonEngineRenderOptions} options - The options to render.
   * @returns {Promise<string>} Promise which resolves with the rendered HTML as a string
   *                            OR rejects with the error, if any is propagated from the rendered app.
