# (EARLY NOTES) Migrating a custom app to use Spartacus with Angular v18

Before upgrading Spartacus to the new version with Angular 18, you need to first:

- upgrade Spartacus to version 2211.32.1
- install Node 22 version
- upgrade `@types/node` to version 22
  ```bash
  npm i @types/node@22
  ```
- upgrade Angular to version v18 and then to v19

## Update Angular to 18 and 19

### Update Angular to 18 and 3rd party deps to be compatible with Angular 18

> **Warning**
>
> Do not select `use-application-builder` migration when migrating to Angular 18. Applications created before SPA 2211.19 doesn't support this builder. Applications created starting from 2211.19 already support it.

Follow the [Angular guidelines for upgrading from v17 to v18](https://angular.dev/update-guide?v=17.0-18.0&l=3) and bump the Angular version locally, and update other 3rd party dependencies from Angular ecosystem  to versions compatible with Angular 18 (e.g. `@ng-select/ng-select@13`, `@ngrx/store@18`, `ngx-infinite-scroll@18`):

```bash
ng update @angular/core@18 @angular/cli@18 @ng-select/ng-select@13 @ngrx/store@18 ngx-infinite-scroll@18 --force
git add .
git commit -m "update angular 18 and 3rd party deps angular 18 compatible"
```


### Update Angular to 19 and 3rd party deps to be compatible with Angular 19

> **Warning**
>
> Hit SPACE to unselect `use-application-builder` migration when migrating to Angular 19. Applications created before SPA 2211.19 doesn't support this builder. Applications created starting from 2211.19 already support it.

Follow the [Angular guidelines for upgrading from v18 to v19](https://angular.dev/update-guide?v=18.0-19.0&l=3) and bump the Angular version locally, and update other 3rd party dependencies from Angular ecosystem  to versions compatible with Angular 19 (e.g. `@ng-select/ng-select@14`, `@ngrx/store@19`, `ngx-infinite-scroll@19`):

```bash
ng update @angular/cli@19 @angular/core@19 ngx-infinite-scroll@19 @ng-select/ng-select@14 @ngrx/store@19 angular-oauth2-oidc@19 --force
git add .
git commit -m "update angular 19 and 3rd party deps angular 19 compatible"
```



## Run Spartacus update

After successfully updating the application to Angular 19, execute this command to initiate the Spartacus update process.

```bash
ng update @spartacus/schematics@latest
```

### If using Server Side Rendering (SSR) and `application` builder

For applications with SSR support that use the Angular's `application` builder (i.e. having in `angular.json` the following value: `... "architect": { "build": { "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:application", ...`), you need to adjust the `server.ts` file to be compatible with the output generated by this builder. 

```diff
/* ... */
- const indexHtml = join(browserDistFolder, 'index.html');
+ const indexHtml = join(serverDistFolder, 'index.server.html');
```
